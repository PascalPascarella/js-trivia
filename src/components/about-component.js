					Hi my name is Brendan. I am a student at Bellevue University and I study\
					Web Development. I hope to be a Web Developer. I’ve worked as a\
					Copywriter for a Law Firm and also as a Prep Cook. My favorite\
					Framework is express. I also like jquery. This is my first time writing in\
					Slack.\
					I’m a transfer student. I used to go to University of New Hampshire for\
					Psychology. I’ve found the program at Bellevue was way better for Web\
					Development. I was/am impressed by the curriculum.\
					Some more facts about me: I like to produce music and then go skiing and film it and then I\
					make movies. I like to travel and film too. That was my introduction! Thanks for reading!</p>\

					Jeff is a student at Bellevue University working towards a bachelor’s\
					degree in Web Development. Prior to enrolling at Bellevue he earned a\
					degree in Programming for Database/Web from Metropolitan\
					Community College. He’s been exposed to several different\
					programming languages including Java and C#. Metro also showed him\
					the basics of SQL and database interactions. Jeff also attended AIM\
					Code School, learning the fundamentals of web development and full\
					stack .NET development. Jeff is anxious to learn full stack JavaScript\
					development because unlike Java or C#, both the front end and the back end are written in the\
					same language. He also has a degree in Welding, choosing to specialize in GTAW/TIG welding\
					for clean, precise welds on thin materials. Jeff has also volunteered at the Community Bike\
					Project Omaha for the last seven years, where he teaches youth Earn-a-Bike classes. He’s also\
					helped organize events like the Full Cycle Supper, a five-course progressive dinner catered by\
					local chefs, and Exhibiketion, a bicycle themed art show.</p>\

					Joann is a student at Bellevue University that is currently pursuing a\
					bachelor degree in Web Development. She has decided to transfer from a\
					Medical school that was partnered with Bellevue University called\
					Ultimate Medical Academy. From that school she has received an\
					Associate degree in Medical Billing and Coding. Her dream was to work\
					in a healthcare and a non-healthcare field. Joann has volunteered to work\
					at the community website forum at Pokémon’s Revolution Online, where\
					she became a chat moderator there and from that aspect, she has gained several new experiences\
					and knowledge that has strengthened her skills.</p>\

					<p class="about-profileCard-text">\
					Pascal has been a student at Bellevue University for a little under a year\
					at the time of writing. He is pursuing a degree in Computer Science &\
					Web Development after his time in the United States Army, where he\
					worked closely with contractors upgrading and deploying new versions\
					of the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System. His experience\
					with hardware and software development was honed alongside men and\
					women who have been leaders in the field for nearly two decades.\
					Although Pascal was aware of HTML and CSS, it wasn’t until his recent\
					classes that he realized how easily the two could be used to make front-end files aesthetic and\
					accessible. In his off time, he enjoys building Conway’s “Game of Life” in new languages and is\
					looking forward to adding JavaScript to the list! Pascal grew up in small town in rural Texas to\
					parents who were world-travelers. The appreciation for different cultures was contagious and he\
					enjoys his own stints of globe-trotting, along with the ease afforded to him by online academia.\
					Currently, he resides outside of Austin, TX, with his cat, Virgil.\
